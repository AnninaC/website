## The COVID Community Vulnerability Index

The Community Vulnerability Index (CVI) is the first public project developed by the non-profit Community Insight and Impact (website link to be added soon). 

CVI was started during the New Lab COVID-19 [Data Hack](https://newlab.com/event/covid-19-data-hack/) and aims to provide a variety of indices to assess community vulnerability to the impact of COVID-19, including adverse health outcomes, and disparate socioeconomic harms, across the entire US at the county level. We intend this to be usable by a variety of stakeholders: by healthcare systems to identify testing and service deserts and effectively allocate existing resources, by community organizations to find outreach areas and understand needs, and by policymakers to inform funding and decision making.
