### Organization Values 
**Data belongs to the people:** We are committed to using open data and making the details of our analyses accessible to and interpretable by the people they affect.
<br><br>
**Community voices must be elevated:** We exist to serve communities and believe their needs, opinions, and concerns must be incorporated at every stage of analysis. 
<br><br>
**Data responsibility is necessary:** Data must be collected, analyzed, stored, and distributed in a manner that is equitable and respects privacy and data rights. 
<br><br>
**Diversity at every level:** We are committed to building a team that is diverse along all axes and believe all backgrounds and skill sets are necessary to making data accessible and equitable.
<br><br>
**A fully transparent organization:** Members are involved in all levels of decision making; concerns and input are actively sought, not just accepted. All work is well-documented and interpretable. 
<br><br>
**Our work benefits everyone:** We exist to serve the community, and that includes our members. Professional interests and growth opportunities drive all assignments.
